# 📘 BookIT – Digital Infrastructure and Web Services Project

## 🧠 Project Overview
BookIT is a RESTful web service designed to manage room bookings at a fictional university department called the **Department of Infographics and Trivia (IT)**.  
The project demonstrates how to build and document scalable digital infrastructures using **OpenAPI 3.0**, **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**, and **Microservices Architecture (MSA)** principles.



# ⚙️ Features
-Add, edit, and delete rooms (admin access)  
-View available and booked rooms  
-View rooms by floor plan  
-Manage room bookings (create, update, delete)  
-Handle errors for invalid requests  
-Includes **HATEOAS links** for better API navigation  



# 🧰 Technologies Used
**OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger)** – API specification and documentation  
**REST Architecture** – Resource-based web service design  
**XML / XSD** – Data structure and validation  
**JSON / JSON Schema** – Lightweight data interchange format  
**GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  



# 🏗️ Architecture Reflection
A detailed reflection on BookIT’s digital infrastructure, migration path from monolithic to microservices, and sustainability considerations is included in the **[bookit.docx](bookit.docx)** file.



# 🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Designed a RESTful API with OpenAPI  
- Validated XML and JSON documents  
- Explored digital infrastructure design patterns (Monolithic, SOA, MSA)  
- Understood scalability, interoperability, and sustainability challenges
